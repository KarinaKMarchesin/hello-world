# hello-world
World with no bounderies

My name is Karina. I'm Brazilian and live in Brazil, a big and beautiful country with huge economic, social and cultural differences. 
I'm a lawyer and passionate for travel and different cultures. In a world with a rich diversity, the economic contrast arises and overlaps.
I worked for a long time as a Judge advisor. My goal is to pursue justice and through education bring oppotunities for those who do not have them.
